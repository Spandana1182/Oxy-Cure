# Oxy-Cure

Domain: Healthcare
Statement: Conceive a solution that enables oxygen concentrator seekers (individuals) to connect with vendors and act as a bridge in the oxygen supply chain.  

Our project aims to mend the oxygen supply chain by connecting vendors to potential oxygen seekers. We intend to achieve this by means of a Mobile App that provides vendors a platform to log their inventory and put themselves on the map. 

dataset_app - vendor database updation
app-release - maps activity
app - sos app


SOS:

1. Long presss icon to update emergency contact
2. Press icon to toggle SOS

Due to errors in Google Maps API, as mentioned in the submission. We were not able to complete the project on time. The apps act as standalone for now. 
We will work on this beyond the timeframe of the hackathon and integrate the apps and complete it when the errors are resolved.
