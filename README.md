# Oxy-Cure

**Domain**: Healthcare<br>
**Statement**: Conceive a solution that enables oxygen concentrator seekers (individuals) to connect with vendors and act as a bridge in the oxygen supply chain.  

Our project aims to mend the oxygen supply chain by connecting vendors to potential oxygen seekers. We intend to achieve this by means of a Mobile App that provides vendors a platform to log their inventory and put themselves on the map. 

dataset_app : Vendor Database Updation<br>
app-release : Main App (location detection)<br>
app         : SOS APP<br>


**Vendor Database** : https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ezJW6utPiIEetCVtXl5WQ0Z_KI-RJ1x5ClPSenMpyV0/edit?usp=sharing 
Currently, access to edit this dataset is restricted, and nly the authorised admin can add vendors via the afforementioned app. This is a sensitive issue since improper information could be potentially dangerous. This addition is done after in person validation checks.


**SOS**:

1. Long presss icon to update emergency contact
2. Press icon to toggle SOS


**App-Release** (still a work in progress): 

Due to errors in Google Maps API, as mentioned in the submission. We were not able to complete and integrate the apps into one project on time. The apps act as standalone for now. 
We will work on this beyond the timeframe of the hackathon and integrate the apps when the errors are resolved. So the current functionality is limited to just showing the current location of the user when tapping the re-centre icon on the top right of the app screen.
