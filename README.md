# Oxy-Cure

Domain: Healthcare
Statement: Conceive a solution that enables oxygen concentrator seekers (individuals) to connect with vendors and act as a bridge in the oxygen supply chain.  

Our project aims to mend the oxygen supply chain by connecting vendors to potential oxygen seekers. We intend to achieve this by means of a Mobile App that provides vendors a platform to log their inventory and put themselves on the map.
